## Types

WEAKLY TYPED, WILL BE TYPE INFERENCE

* Numbers
* Strings (NO CHARACTERS)
* Booleans
* Objects (Things)
* Arrays (Stuffs) Homogenous Types
* Function (Be)
* Undefined (Whut)

## Variables 

There will be constants
There will be variables you can change 

## Operators
### Arithmetic Operators
* \+ SQUISH
* \- RIP | STEAL | TAKE
* \/ BREAK 
* \* MANY
* % LEFT
* ++ LITTLE SQUISH
* -- LITTLE STEAL /RIP
* ** MANY MANY

### Relational Operators
* == IS IS
* <= NOT SMASH OR IS
* >= SMASH OR IS
* < NOT SMASH
* > SMASH
* != NOT IS

### Logical Operator
* && AND
* || OR
* ! NOT

### Bitwise Operators
* &	Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands.	(A & B) = 12, i.e., 0000 1100
* |	Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand.	(A | B) = 61, i.e., 0011 1101
* ^	Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.	(A ^ B) = 49, i.e., 0011 0001
* *~	Binary One's Complement Operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits.	(~A ) = ~(60), i.e,. -0111101
* <<	Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.	
* >>	Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right
